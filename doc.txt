Banker's Algorithm Implementation: Documentation

How It Works:

This project implements the Banker's Algorithm for a hypothetical system where
there are three resources that must be shared among five currently running
processes. The Banker's Algorithm must take four data structures into account
to complete this task: 1) total available resources, 2) maximum resource
demand [per process], 3) current resource allocation [per process], and
4) resource need [per process]. To calculate resource need for a process, the 
current resource allocation must be subtracted from its maximum demand.

The algorithm checks for safety by running a hypothetical scenario in which
one of the currently active processes is allowed to request its maximum resources
and complete. For a process to be eligible to do this, its maximum resource
demands must be less than the sum of the currently available resources and
the resources currently allocated to said process. The algorithm then supposes
the process after completion, calculating the new available resources after
the process has released all of its resources to the system. It then searches
for a remaining process whose maximum demand is less than the available resources.

Assuming the algorithm is always able to find and eligible process to continue
building the safe sequence, it will continue this loop until there are no
processes remaining. Otherwise, the algorithm must check for another eligible
process and try again. If every process at a particular step of the sequence
fails, the algorithm must take a step back and look for a different eligible
process from there, and so on. If the system is in an unsafe state, the
algorithm will build every safe sequence it can, and they will all be incomplete.

Upon reading the provided system state in 'input.txt', the algorithm
will determine that the system is in a SAFE state, and produce a corresponding
safe sequence: P1, P3, P0, P2, P4.
